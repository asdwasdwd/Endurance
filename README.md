## Why use Endurance over RST Striker?
RST Striker is old, outdated, and doesn't receive updates. Endurance aims to provide a togglable, easy-to-use and minimal interface that doesn't clutter your screen with an oversized UI. Endurance will constantly receive bug fixes and features as new exploitable vulnerbilities are found in the game.
